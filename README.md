EinsteinMan
===========

Introduction
------------

EinteinMan is a Pacman style arcade game that is designed to
simulate the length contraction effects of special relativity.
It was created as PSET 0 for the 8.20 IAP class at MIT. 

You play as Albert Einstein trying to navigate the map at c/2
speed in order to collect points whilst trying to escape the
wrath of Niels Bohr who is also travelling at c/2. Everything
is contracted according to Einstein's perspective.
